**Lagune** helps your AI agent make a project more secure. You point it at your code, and the agent figures out what your system actually does, then guides you through the security work that matters for it.

- **Lagune** works with projects in **any programming language** and supports [**66 agents**](https://lagune.ai/docs/supported-agents) ✨

## Get Started

**Lagune** adapts to your environment, whether it is a new project or an existing one.

> [!TIP]
>
> No API keys are needed, it runs directly through your own agent [(**Claude**, **Codex**, and more)](https://lagune.ai/docs/supported-agents).

---

### Dashboard

For an interactive live view, follow-up, and maintenance, run:

```bash
npx -y lagune@latest
```

It serves a dashboard and opens it in a random port:

- [x] **Live Reload**
- [x] **Private** and **Local**
- [x] **Install**, **Pull**, **Update**, and **Manage** all **Lagune** features directly from your browser
- [x] No `node_modules` or `package.json` is needed 📦

> [!TIP]

> - 🚪 Use `--port` or `-p` to specify a custom port.
> - ⏏️ Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

---

### CLI

#### › Install

```bash
npx -y lagune@latest init
```

- 🃏 **Lagune** runs on **Node.js** under the hood, you use whatever language you want.

#### › Update

To update **Lagune**'s own files and its commands to their latest versions, run:

```bash
npx -y lagune@latest update
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Your charter, the phase artifacts, and any custom specializations stay untouched.

#### › Pull

When you clone or fork a project that already has **Lagune**, run pull to install its files from the manifest:

```bash
npx -y lagune@latest pull
```

> [!TIP]
>
> 💡 Think of it as the **Lagune** equivalent of `npm i`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and the like.

---

### Slash Commands

Once **Lagune** is set up in your project, your **AI** agent unlocks a set of slash commands:

#### › Development flow

Secure the work as you build it, guided by the charter, with no flow to follow:

| Command                                               | What it does for you                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**/lagune**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/lagune) | Enforces security along with your development, on any prompt, at any time |

- Pull in the on-demand specializations in real time while your agent works.
- Combine it with the [**/lagune.charter**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/charter) command to shape every build around your project's own security rules.

#### › The Blue Team flow

These five run in order. Each builds on the previous, so following the list top to bottom is all it takes:

| #   | Command                                                        | What it does for you                                                           |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | [**/lagune.charter**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/charter) | Sets your project's security rules, proposed for you or shaped by what you say |
| 2   | [**/lagune.detect**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/detect)   | Reads your code and maps what your system does and where the risks are         |
| 3   | [**/lagune.plan**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/plan)       | Turns what detect found into a defense plan, with a fix for each finding       |
| 4   | [**/lagune.harden**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/harden)   | Applies the plan's fixes to your code, safely and one at a time                |
| 5   | [**/lagune.verify**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/verify)   | Proves each applied fix holds and closes out the ones that do                  |

#### › Special commands

| Command                                                              | What it does                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**/lagune.specialize**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/specialize) | Specializes **Lagune** in a new security _sub_-skill from articles, exploits, or topics |
| [**/lagune.prove**](https://lagune.ai/docs/commands/prove)           | Turns each detected finding into a runnable proof for responsible disclosure            |

> [!TIP]
>
> Security is not a cost, it is an investment: what you put in upfront, you save many times over in the incidents you never have 🙋🏻‍♂️

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> See the full [**documentation**](https://lagune.ai/) for usage examples and more.
