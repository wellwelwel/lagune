## Rules

- This specialization audits and explains.
- By default, it never rewrites your code.

## What to look for

Two of Go's design choices, an interface as a (type, value) pair and goroutines over shared memory, turn into the risks below. Neither is a syntax error: the code compiles and often passes a casual test, then misbehaves where a security decision or a concurrent path depends on it.

### Typed-nil interface comparison (`nil != nil`)

A Go interface value is a (type, value) pair, and it equals `nil` only when both halves are nil. Assigning a typed nil pointer (`var p *T = nil`) to an interface produces a non-nil interface (type `*T`, value nil), so a comparison that looks correct silently goes the wrong way.

The classic instance is an `error` return: a function returns a `*MyError` that is nil, but the caller's `if err != nil` is true anyway, so error handling misfires. The impact is incorrect control flow, a nil-receiver panic (DoS), or a failed operation treated as successful, a security-relevant logic error on an auth, validation, or payment path.

```go
func do() error {
    var e *MyError = nil
    return e            // interface is (*MyError, nil), NOT nil
}

if do() != nil { /* always taken */ }
```

Safer shapes, applied where they fit:

- When a function returns an interface, return literal `nil` on success, not a typed nil pointer:

  ```go
  func do() error {
      if somethingFailed {
          return &MyError{ /* ... */ }
      }
      return nil // explicit untyped nil
  }
  ```

- When a nil check on an interface holding a concrete pointer is unavoidable, use a type assertion or `reflect.ValueOf(i).IsNil()`.
- Enable `go vet` and the `nilness` analyzer (`golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/nilness`), which flags nil-pointer dereferences and degenerate nil comparisons, and the `nilerr` linter (via `golangci-lint`), which flags returning `nil` after an `err != nil` check.

### Data races from goroutines sharing memory (incl. pre-1.22 loop-variable capture)

Go encourages many goroutines over shared memory, and its memory model permits a data race to produce an arbitrary result, including memory corruption for multiword values (interfaces, slices, maps, strings) where a torn (pointer, len) or (pointer, type) pair can be observed. A concurrent map write is explicitly fatal. The well-known instance was the per-loop, not per-iteration, loop variable: pre-Go 1.22, `for _, v := range items { go func(){ use(v) }() }` had every goroutine close over the same `v` and observe the final value, printing `c, c, c` instead of `a, b, c`.

The impact is wrong results feeding logic or security decisions, and shared map or slice writes that corrupt memory or crash (DoS).

Safer shapes, applied where they fit:

- Run tests under the race detector (`go test -race`, `go run -race`) on realistic, load, and integration tests. It is the canonical tool, and it only reports races on the paths it actually executes, so coverage matters.
- Protect shared state with `sync.Mutex`/`sync.RWMutex`, or confine each variable to a single goroutine and communicate over channels ("share memory by communicating"). Use `sync/atomic` for counters.
- For the loop-variable bug before 1.22, pass the variable as a parameter (`go func(v T){ /* ... */ }(v)`) or rebind it (`v := v`). Go 1.22 made loop variables per-iteration, but only in modules that declare `go 1.22` or later, and it does not fix general shared-memory races.

## How to act on the result

- **In detect (detection):** each pattern you confirm is a finding. Describe it in plain language: what it is (a typed nil reaching an interface comparison, or shared memory touched by concurrent goroutines without synchronization), why it matters (the concrete impact, for example an `err != nil` always true on a success path, a nil-receiver panic, or a data race feeding an auth decision), and the evidence (the function, return, or goroutine where it lives). It flows through detect's normal steps and is tracked like any other finding.
- **In verify (proof):** the control holds only when every confirmed pattern meets its Safer shapes from the body:
  1. interface-returning functions return literal `nil` on success, or guard the comparison with a type assertion / `reflect` nil check.
  2. shared state crossing goroutines is protected by a mutex, confined to one goroutine over channels, or made atomic, with the loop-variable case fixed by per-parameter passing or a `go 1.22`+ module.

  The race detector passing on the exercised paths is strong supporting evidence, not a proof on its own, since it only sees the paths it runs. If a typed nil can still reach a nil comparison, or shared memory can still be raced, record it as not closed and point back to harden.
