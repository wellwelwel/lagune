## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

The User Input is the work to do, so read it before proceeding. It may fill the block above, come after this command's text, arrive as the user's next message, or sit around the command's name in the message that called it. A placeholder left in the block is never the input, and when none of these places holds any, the User Input is empty.

## Outline

You are doing the work the prompt asks for (a login page, an upload, an endpoint, whatever it is), and **making it secure as you build it**: the same work you would do anyway, built so the code is safe-by-default the moment it lands. This bends to any prompt at any stage, from a first scaffold to a change on a mature codebase.

### Step 1: Load the charter

Read the charter at `.lagune/memory/charter.md`, if it exists: its security principles are the rules every part of this work must respect. When there is none, proceed on the safe-by-default baseline the specializations carry, and tell the user in one line that you are working without a charter.

### Step 2: Work out what you are about to build

Before any specialization or any code, think through the work the prompt asks for the way you normally would: what you will build, the pieces it needs, and the boundaries it crosses. A login page implies credentials, a session, and a form that takes input from outside. An upload implies a file crossing a boundary and landing somewhere. An endpoint implies untrusted input and a response.

This is your own reasoning, not a checklist, and its only job is to give Step 3 something concrete to match: the security-relevant surfaces of what you are about to build.

A prompt may also mention a side quest, the dashboard's name for anything a phase left open under `.lagune/memory/`: detect's **Not determined**, plan's **Open questions**, and harden's **Remaining**.

### Step 3: Match the specializations to the work

Specializations are focused, language-agnostic security knowledge modules that load only on demand. List the catalog once from the project root:

```bash
npx --yes lagune@0.15.0 catalog
```

It prints each specialization this project uses as `name: tags`, suffixing ` [required]` on any the catalog flags. The tags say what each one covers. Reach a verdict on every entry, one at a time:

- **`[required]`:** always applies. Its knowledge governs the work regardless of what you are building.
- **Its context is in the work:** the thing its tags name is part of what you are about to build (its tags say uploads and you are building an upload). It applies.
- **Its context is not in the work:** nothing you are building touches what its tags name. Skip it. Most entries will not apply to a given piece of work, and that is normal.

Judge from your Step 2 reasoning, not from how relevant an entry feels. Read every entry that applies with `npx --yes lagune@0.15.0 catalog <name>`, one at a time: each carries the defense knowledge for its class of work (uploads, shell, sessions, and so on). Keep the list of specializations you applied for Steps 5 and 6.

### Step 4: Build it, safe-by-default

Build what the prompt asked for and nothing beyond it, exactly as you normally would, with the charter's principles and the matched specializations shaping every security-relevant part. It is the work itself, not an audit of the surrounding code.

- **Apply the defense inline, not afterward.** As you write each part a specialization covers, apply its guidance there and then. Validate input at the boundary, not later. Reach for the safe construct the first time, not after a working-but-unsafe version.
- **Stay safe-by-default.** The result must be safe out of the box, and no feature request outweighs that. Never leave a default that is unsafe until configured.
- **Prefer the simplest vetted control.** Reach for what already exists in order: the project's own tools first, then a platform or framework built-in, then a well-maintained library, and only then custom code. Never hand-roll a security primitive (such as cryptography, escaping, authentication, sessions) a vetted standard already provides.
- **Never break a charter principle to satisfy the prompt.** If doing what was asked would violate a principle, stop and surface the conflict to the user rather than building it that way.
- **Use real, current dependencies.** When a new one is genuinely warranted, pin a real, maintained version and confirm it against current documentation rather than memory.

### Step 5: Check your own work against what you used

Before you call the work done, re-read what you built, without rebuilding it, and confirm the defense holds for each specialization you applied in Step 3 and each charter principle that bears on this work:

- **Is the control on the path, not beside it?** Follow the untrusted data or the risk end to end through what you built, and confirm the guard sits on that path. A safe function written next to the unsafe one that still runs is not applied.
- **Is it complete?** The size limit lands but the file-type check is missing, the one route is guarded but a sibling route is not: an incomplete control leaves the risk reachable.
- **Where a specialization ships a deterministic checker** (a hook it tells you to run), run it over what you built. Its verdict stands over your own reading.

If the check finds a gap, close it now and re-check, until the defense holds across everything you built.

### Step 6: Summarize

Output a short summary to the user, in plain language a non-developer understands:

- What you built, in one or two lines.
- Whether a charter was in effect, or that you worked without one.
- The specializations you applied and, for each, the defense it shaped in what you built. If none applied, say so in one line.
- Any gap Step 5 found, and that it is now closed.
- Any point where the safe choice differed from what was literally asked, and how you resolved it (or the conflict you surfaced, if a principle stopped you).
