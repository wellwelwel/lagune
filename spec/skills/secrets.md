## What to look for

A **secret compiled into the artifact** is a credential (an API key, a token, a password, a private key) that lives in the source instead of in the environment or a secret store. It ships to everyone with repo access and stays in history forever, so a single leak of the code is a leak of the credential. The defect is decidable from the shape of the assignment alone: a literal, not a lookup. Two neighbours belong elsewhere: a secret in a `.tf`/Kubernetes manifest is `infra` (its `secrets-in-data` check), and how a validated secret is stored or rotated is `crypto` (key management).

### Deterministic pre-pass

Run the secrets hook first. It is deterministic and its verdict is literal: it keys on **provenance** (a literal versus an environment lookup), not on the value's contents, so it does not depend on an exhaustive catalog of provider prefixes and produces almost no false positives.

```bash
node ./.lagune/hooks/secrets.mjs           # scans the whole project
node ./.lagune/hooks/secrets.mjs -d <DIR>  # scans a directory
node ./.lagune/hooks/secrets.mjs -f <FILE> # scans a single file
```

It prints up to two sections. **Hardcoded secrets found** is the finding set and exits non-zero, holding the cases whose shape is decisive: a hardcoded fallback for an environment secret (`process.env.X ?? "…"`), a credential embedded in a connection string, or a value matching a curated provider format (AWS `AKIA…`, GitHub `ghp_…`, Stripe `sk_live_…`, a PEM private key). **Secret handling to review manually** is the lead set: a plain literal bound to a secret-named identifier, whose name and shape cannot prove it is a real credential rather than a hash, public key, or non-secret token, and a secret-named value flowing into a log or response sink. Read each by hand. A clean run prints a single line.

Flagging a committed secret by its format is standard defensive tooling (gitleaks, trufflehog, and GitHub push-protection do the same), shipping detection signatures, never a live secret.

### Reading beyond the hook

- **Split or obfuscated literals:** a token assembled from concatenated parts (`"ghp_" + "…"`) or base64-wrapped to dodge a scanner is the same defect. Treat the assembly as a lead and confirm by resolving it.
- **Secrets in the wrong file:** a `.env` committed to the repo, a credential in a checked-in config, or a key beside the data it protects. The hook skips `.env` and config formats by design (they are expected to be gitignored). Confirm they actually are.
- **A secret that reached a client bundle:** a key inlined into front-end code is public the moment it ships. A `NEXT_PUBLIC_`/`VITE_`-prefixed secret is exposed on purpose and must never be a real credential.

Safer shape: keep every credential out of source, config, and version control. Read it from the environment or a secrets manager at runtime, and if a literal ever reached a commit, rotate it, it is already burned.

Does not close it: deleting the literal from the working tree. The value stays in the history, and in every clone, fork, and mirror already taken, so the credential is burned from the moment it was pushed and only rotation ends it. Moving it into a committed `.env` is the same finding in a new file.

## How to act on the result

- **In detect (detection):** each provider token, environment fallback, and connection-string credential the hook reports is a finding. Record what it is (a committed credential), why it matters (anyone with repo or history access holds the secret), and the evidence (the file and the identifier). A bare literal bound to a secret-named identifier, and a secret flowing into a sink, are leads to confirm, not automatic findings. Confirmed leads flow through detect's normal steps and are tracked like any other finding.
- **In verify (proof):** the control holds only when the credential is gone from the working tree **and** from history, and the code reads it from the environment or a secret store instead. A removed literal that still sits in an old commit is not closed (the secret must be rotated), and a value moved from a literal into a committed `.env` is not closed either. If any credential can still be recovered from the repository or its history, the risk is not closed: record it as such and point back to harden.
