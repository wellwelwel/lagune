description: Apply the defense plan's fixes to the code, safely and one at a time, then record what was applied and what is left. Reads the defense plan and the charter, then hardens every fix, just the fixes, files, or directories you name, or the priorities you choose.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

The User Input above decides how this command runs. Read it before proceeding.

## Outline

You are applying the **defense plan** to the code and producing a **hardening record** at `.bluespec/memory/harden.md`: a record of which plan fixes were applied, what changed in the code, and what is still left. This phase **continues from plan**. Plan already decided the fix for each finding and its priority, so this phase does not re-decide the fix: it applies it. Every change you make must come from a fix that is really in the defense plan, never a fix you invent here. This is the one phase that **changes the user's code**, so it is the one that must be the most careful: it confirms with the user before it starts.

The defense plan is the primary input: the changes follow from the fixes it lists. The charter is the governing context: its principles still bind what you do, and a fix must never be applied in a way that breaks one.

### Step 1: Decide the scope from the input

This phase is built entirely on the defense plan. It applies fixes the plan already decided. The User Input above selects one of three modes:

- **No input** (the User Input is empty): apply **every fix** in the defense plan, highest priority first. This is the full hardening pass across the planned context.
- **Fixes, files, or directories given** (the input names one or more fix names from the plan, or paths in the project): apply only the matching fixes. Match a name to the plan's fix names, and match a path to the fixes through the tracking map (`.bluespec/tracking.json`), which records the paths each fix points at. Leave the rest of the plan untouched.
- **One or more priorities chosen** (the input names priorities, for example `High`, or `High and Medium`): apply only the fixes the plan gave any of those priorities. The pass covers those priority bands, not the whole plan.

If the input is ambiguous, prefer the most literal reading (an existing path is a path, a known fix name is a fix), and state which mode you chose before continuing.

### Step 2: Load context

- Load the defense plan at `.bluespec/memory/plan.md`. This is the **required primary input**.
  - If it does not exist, **stop and tell the user to run `/bluespec.plan` first**. There is nothing to apply without it. Do not invent fixes to work around a missing plan.
  - If it exists, read its fixes. Each fix's name, priority, the principle it upholds, any `Depends on` it carries, and the finding it points at is what you apply. Apply only fixes that are really in the plan.
  - **Check that the scope is covered by the plan** before applying:
    - If **nothing** in the scope you chose is in the plan (the named fixes match no fix, the named paths match no fix's finding evidence, or no fix carries any of the named priorities), **stop and tell the user** to run `/bluespec.plan` on that scope first, then run the harden phase again. Do not apply a change the plan did not call for.
    - If the scope is **partly** covered, apply the fixes that are in the plan, and record each uncovered part under **Remaining**. Do not stop, and do not invent a fix for the uncovered part.
- Load the hardening record at `.bluespec/memory/harden.md`.
  - If it does not exist, initialize it from the template at `.bluespec/templates/harden-template.md` first, and identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
  - If it already exists, read what was applied before. You will reconcile it in Step 3 before applying anything new. Each applied block's identity is the plan fix it points at plus the change it records.
- Load the charter at `.bluespec/memory/charter.md` for the governing principles, **if it exists**. The principles still bind here: never apply a fix in a way that breaks one. If the charter does not exist, apply the fixes from the plan alone.
- Load the sub-skills that detect applied. The "Applied sub-skills" section of `.bluespec/memory/detect.md` lists them by path (`.bluespec/skills/<name>.md`). Read each file, not just the list: each carries the defense knowledge for its class of finding (uploads, shell, network, and so on), which Step 4 uses to apply the matching fix. If a listed file is missing, note it and apply the fix from the plan and charter alone.

### Step 3: Reconcile the existing record

This record is reconciled, never append-only. If the record was empty or freshly initialized, skip this step. Otherwise, before applying anything new, re-check each existing applied block against the current code:

- **Still holds:** the change is still in the code and the plan still carries its fix. Keep it, and update its wording or evidence if the code moved on.
- **Reverted or dropped:** the change is no longer in the code, or the plan no longer carries that fix. **Remove the block** from the record. Do not keep stale entries for history. The record reflects the code as it is now.
- Only re-check blocks that fall within the current scope. A block outside the scope you are running stays untouched.

A block whose finding `verify` already proved closed was stood down out of the whole chain, so it is simply absent here. That absence is expected, not a broken chain, and is no reason to run repair.

If reconciling reveals the chain is inconsistent (for example the tracking map points a control at a file that was renamed or moved, so the path on record no longer exists), run `/bluespec.repair` and then continue. Repair fixes Blue Spec's internal tracking across every phase at once, so the chain stays coherent. Do not try to repair the tracking yourself: this phase reconciles its own record in prose, repair owns the tracking.

### Step 4: Apply the fixes, safely and one at a time

This is the one place Blue Spec changes the user's code. Apply the planned fixes carefully:

- **Confirm before you change anything.** List the in-scope fixes you are about to apply, by name, in the order you will apply them: dependencies first, then highest priority. Ask the user for one confirmation to proceed. If they decline, change nothing, stop, and tell them nothing was applied. If they ask to leave some fixes out, skip those and apply the rest. Only then start editing.
- **One fix at a time, dependencies first, then highest priority.** When a fix carries a `Depends on`, apply the fix it depends on before it, even when that one's priority is lower. Among the fixes free to apply, follow priority order (Critical, then High, then Medium, then Low). Apply each fix on its own so each change stays small, reviewable, and easy to undo.
- **Apply the smallest change that holds the control.** Make the fix the plan described, nothing more. Do not refactor unrelated code, do not add features, do not widen the change beyond the fix.
- **Apply each fix the way its sub-skill prescribes.** When a finding's class has a sub-skill loaded in Step 2, apply the plan's fix in line with that sub-skill's guidance. The plan decides the fix, the sub-skill informs how to apply it safely. Where they speak to the same control, follow both.
- **Stay safe-by-default.** The change must leave the project safe out of the box. Never weaken an existing control to apply a new one, and never break a charter principle to satisfy a fix. If a fix would conflict with a principle, stop and surface the conflict to the user rather than applying it.
- **Use real, current dependencies when one is needed.** If a fix needs a library, prefer the project's existing tools, and when a new one is genuinely needed, pin a real, maintained version and note it. Confirm the version against current documentation rather than memory.
- **When a fix cannot be fully applied**, apply what you safely can and record the rest. Mark the block `Partial` with what is left, or `Blocked` with the reason, and leave the plan fix open. Do not force a change you are unsure of.

### Step 5: Fill the template

- Replace every placeholder with concrete text. Leave no bracket tokens behind.
- Set `Scope` to reflect the mode you ran: all fixes, the named fixes or paths, or the chosen priorities.
- **Merge, do not overwrite.** The record now holds the reconciled blocks from Step 3 plus what you applied in Step 4. Add a new block only for a fix you actually applied this run, not already represented. Do not duplicate a block that is already there under a different wording.
- Write one block per applied finding, titled with the finding's name (verbatim from the plan and detect, no action prefix). Each block MUST carry these parts:
  - **Status:** one of `Applied`, `Partial`, or `Blocked`.
    - **Applied:** the control is fully in place in the code.
    - **Partial:** some of the control is in place, the rest goes under Remaining.
    - **Blocked:** the control could not be applied, with the reason, and the plan fix stays open.
  - **What changed:** the change made, in plain language any reader understands.
  - **Where:** a short, plain-language note of where the change landed (the function or area) and any dependency added, so the change can be reviewed and the next phase can verify it. Do not write the file path here. The path goes to the tracking map in Step 7, where reconcile keeps it current through a rename.
- The template ships with three starter blocks. This is a starting point, not a limit. Add or remove blocks so the record matches what was actually applied.
- Record anything left under **Remaining**: the rest of a Partial fix, a Blocked fix and why, or a fix this run did not reach. Name the plan fix each item belongs to. Remove that section if every in-scope fix is fully `Applied`.
- Set `Hardened` to today's date in ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Step 6: Validate before writing

- No bracket tokens remain.
- Every block is titled with a finding name that really exists in the defense plan, and carries Status, What changed, and Where.
- No block for a finding the plan no longer carries, or a change no longer in the code, is still in the record, and no block is duplicated.
- Every `Status` is one of `Applied`, `Partial`, or `Blocked`, and every `Partial` or `Blocked` fix has a matching entry under Remaining.
- Nothing was applied before the user confirmed the run, and any fix the user left out was not applied.
- No applied change breaks a charter principle or weakens an existing control.
- Each applied fix whose class has a sub-skill follows that sub-skill's guidance, with nothing it says about the applied control skipped.
- The `Scope` line matches the mode you actually ran.
- The date is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Step 7: Write and summarize

- Write the reconciled record to `.bluespec/memory/harden.md`.
- Register the items you hardened so the tracking map keeps each one current. This is registration, not reconciliation: hand the track hook only the findings this run hardened, as the `entries` list of `{name, paths}`, named by the finding's name (your section title, the same name the plan used). The hook finds that same item by name and updates its `paths`. It does not create a second entry: one finding is one item. `name` is the finding's name, and `paths` holds the file paths the change landed in. The path lives here, in tracking, never in the prose. Run it from the project root, passing the payload as the single argument:

```bash
node ./.bluespec/hooks/track.mjs '{"entries":[{"name":"<FINDING NAME>","paths":["<PATH>"]}]}'
```

Do not edit `.bluespec/tracking.json` yourself, and do not reconcile here. Track only advances what this phase hardened. Repairing the map across the conveyor stays with `/bluespec.repair`.

- Output a short summary to the user:
  - The scope you ran (all fixes, named fixes or paths, or priorities).
  - The fixes applied, each with its status and a one-line note of what changed, in the order you applied them.
  - What changed since the last run: blocks added, blocks removed because the fix is gone or the change was reverted, and blocks updated.
  - Anything left under Remaining, including any part of the scope the plan did not cover, and any Blocked fix.
  - A suggested commit message, for example `fix: apply security hardening from the defense plan`.
  - **Next step:** point the user to `/bluespec.verify`, the phase that proves each applied control actually holds. Make clear the applied controls are not yet proven until verify confirms them. Frame it as the recommended next step. If anything is left under Remaining (a Blocked fix, or a part the plan did not cover), name what is still open so the user can decide whether to revisit `/bluespec.plan` or rerun `/bluespec.harden` before verifying.

Keep the record in plain language throughout. A non-developer should understand what was changed and what is still open, while the `Where` note stays precise enough that, with the path from the tracking map, `/bluespec.verify` can act on it.
